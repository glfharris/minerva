## Question 1


A 60-year-old male patient is undergoing surgery and requires muscle relaxation. The anaesthetist decides to use a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocker. After administration, the anaesthetist monitors the neuromuscular block using a peripheral nerve stimulator.

**Which of the following patterns of response is most indicative of a partial non-depolarising neuromuscular block?**

Reduced but equal twitch height in single twitch stimulation
Fade in tetanic stimulation
Post-tetanic facilitation
Train-of-four ratio greater than 0.7
Increased twitch response after anticholinesterase administration

**Correct:** Fade in tetanic stimulation 

A partial non-depolarising neuromuscular block is characterized by a fade in response to tetanic stimulation. This occurs due to the blockade of presynaptic acetylcholine receptors, preventing positive feedback and reducing acetylcholine mobilisation during high-frequency stimulation.

## Question 2


You are using isoflurane (vaporizer dial setting 2.0%, end-tidal concentration = 1.2%) to maintain anaesthesia using a circle system with the vaporizer out-of-circuit and fresh gas flow (FGF) = 400 ml min-1 of an oxygen/air mixture. It is now necessary to increase the depth of anaesthesia to 1.5 MAC equivalent.

**Which of the following is the quickest method of increasing the depth of anaesthesia to 1.5 MAC equivalent?**

Change the vaporizer setting to isoflurane 1.5%
Increase the FGF to 8 L min-1
Increase the vaporizer setting by 50%
Switch to a nitrous oxide/oxygen mix with FiO2 = 0.3
Switch to a nitrous oxide/oxygen mix with FiO2 = 0.5

**Correct:** Increase the FGF to 8 L min-1 

Changing the composition of the inspired gas mixture will take a long time at such a low FGF rate due to the inertia of the circle system. The quickest option to increase the end-tidal isoflurane concentration is to increase the FGF rate. Option A does not achieve 1.5 MAC (MAC isoflurane = 1.2%). Option E does achieve this and option D overachieves but will take longer due to the time needed to change the gas composition in the circle system.

## Question 3


A patient receives a continuous intravenous infusion of a drug that follows first-order kinetics. The aim is to maintain a steady-state plasma concentration of the drug.

**Which of the following factors primarily determines the time to reach steady-state concentration?**

Drug's half-life
Infusion rate
Volume of distribution
Bioavailability
Loading dose

**Correct:** Drug's half-life 

The time to reach steady-state concentration in first-order kinetics is primarily determined by the drug's half-life. It generally takes about 4-5 half-lives to reach steady-state. Infusion rate determines the steady-state concentration, but not the time to reach it. Volume of distribution and bioavailability are not directly related to steady-state time, and loading dose is used to achieve target concentration rapidly, not to determine steady-state time.

## Question 4


You are comparing pressure-volume curves in patients during an asthma attack compared with healthy subjects.

**Which of the following observed differences is the best indicator of the increased work of breathing in the patients with asthma?**

Larger hysteresis loop
Longer expiratory time
Pressure-volume curve starts at a higher end-expiratory pressure
Slope of the inspiratory limb is initially less steep
Tidal volume is smaller

**Correct:** Larger hysteresis loop 

The work of breathing is best indicated by the area within the hysteresis loop.

## Question 5


A pregnant woman is undergoing an ultrasound examination. The sonographer notes the presence of the ductus venosus in the foetal circulation.

**Which of the following best describes the role of the ductus venosus in foetal circulation?**

It supplies oxygenated blood directly to the foetal brain.
It allows oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to bypass the liver and flow into the inferior vena cava.
It is responsible for shunting deoxygenated blood from the right atrium to the left atrium.
It connects the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta to bypass the lungs.
It facilitates the exchange of nutrients between the maternal and foetal circulations.

**Correct:** It allows oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to bypass the liver and flow into the inferior vena cava. 

The ductus venosus is a vascular shunt in the foetal circulation that allows oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to bypass the liver and flow directly into the inferior vena cava. This helps in delivering oxygen-rich blood to the heart and subsequently to vital organs such as the brain. It does not supply blood directly to the brain, nor is it involved in shunting blood between the atria or connecting the pulmonary artery to the aorta. The exchange of nutrients is primarily facilitated by the placenta.

## Question 6


A 65-year-old man is being treated with a drug that follows a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The drug is administered intravenously, and its distribution phase is observed to be rapid, followed by a slower elimination phase.

**Which of the following best describes the initial rapid decline in plasma concentration after administration?**

It is due to the drug being metabolised by the liver.
It represents the drug being distributed into a peripheral compartment.
It indicates immediate renal excretion of the drug.
It shows the drug being absorbed from the site of administration.
It is caused by the drug binding to plasma proteins.

**Correct:** It represents the drug being distributed into a peripheral compartment. 

In a two-compartment model, the initial rapid decline in plasma concentration is due to the distribution of the drug from the central compartment to the peripheral compartment. This phase is followed by a slower elimination phase, which represents the drug being eliminated from the body.

## Question 7


During foetal development, the cardiovascular system undergoes significant adaptations to ensure adequate oxygenation despite low environmental oxygen levels.

**Which of the following adaptations is primarily responsible for directing oxygen-rich blood towards the brain and heart in the foetus?**

The presence of foetal haemoglobin with higher oxygen affinity.
The ductus arteriosus, which diverts blood away from the non-functioning lungs.
The ductus venosus, allowing oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the liver.
The foramen ovale, facilitating blood flow from the right atrium to the left atrium.
The high pulmonary vascular resistance due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

**Correct:** The foramen ovale, facilitating blood flow from the right atrium to the left atrium. 

The foramen ovale is crucial in directing oxygen-rich blood from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing it to be pumped out of the left ventricle into the aorta and preferentially supplying the brain and heart. While options like foetal haemoglobin and ductus arteriosus are important, they do not specifically direct blood to the brain and heart.

## Question 8


A patient with atypical pneumonia is prescribed clarithromycin.

**Inhibition of which of the following mechanisms best explains the antibiotic action of clarithromycin?**

Bacterial energy metabolism
Cell wall synthesis
DNA synthesis
Protein synthesis
RNA synthesis

**Correct:** Protein synthesis 

Macrolides such as clarithromycin inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome and interfering with translocation. The other mechanisms are modes of action of other antibiotics.

## Question 9


A drug has an initial volume of distribution = 0.1 Litre Kg^-1 and a rate constant of elimination k = 0.1 min^-1. It obeys a one-compartment model. An intravenous bolus dose of 500 mg is given to a healthy 50 Kg subject.

**Which of the following is the most likely plasma drug concentration after two minutes?**

1.0 mcg mL^-1
25.2 mcg mL^-1
81.9 mcg mL^-1
98.8 mcg mL^-1
100.0 mcg mL^-1

**Correct:** 81.9 mcg mL^-1 

The initial concentration = Dose/Vd = 500,000 mcg/5,000 mL = 100 mcg.mL^-1. This can be calculated in two ways:

1. Approximate calculation: After one minute, 10% (k expressed as %) of plasma will be cleared of drug, giving a concentration = 90 mcg.mL^-1. Assuming a one compartment model, one minute later, a further 10% will give a concentration = 81 mcg.mL^-1.

2. Exact calculation: Using the equation ln(C/C0) = -kt, we get C = 81.9 mcg mL^-1.

## Question 10


A 65-year-old man presents with acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery. He is found to have a significant reduction in urine output and a rise in serum creatinine levels over the past 24 hours.

**Which of the following is the most likely cause of his acute kidney injury?**

Pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolaemia
Acute tubular necrosis due to ischaemia
Acute interstitial nephritis due to medication
Post-renal obstruction due to catheter blockage
Glomerulonephritis due to autoimmune disease

**Correct:** Acute tubular necrosis due to ischaemia 

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of intrinsic acute kidney injury, especially following cardiac surgery. It is often due to ischaemic damage to the renal tubules as a result of prolonged hypotension or episodes of low cardiac output during the surgical procedure.

## Question 11


A 30-year-old man is undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy under general anaesthesia. During the procedure, the anaesthetist decides to use a neuromuscular blocker to facilitate muscle relaxation. The anaesthetist chooses vecuronium for its minimal cardiovascular effects.

**Which of the following is a characteristic feature of vecuronium compared to pancuronium?**

Vecuronium is more likely to cause tachycardia
Vecuronium is a depolarising muscle relaxant
Vecuronium has a shorter duration of action
Vecuronium causes histamine release
Vecuronium is metabolised by plasma cholinesterase

**Correct:** Vecuronium has a shorter duration of action 

Vecuronium is an aminosteroidal non-depolarising muscle relaxant with minimal cardiovascular effects, unlike pancuronium, which can cause tachycardia due to vagolytic effects. Vecuronium has a shorter duration of action compared to pancuronium. It does not cause histamine release and is not metabolised by plasma cholinesterase.
source: minerva

---
## Question 12


The non-depolarising neuromuscular blocker rocuronium is sometimes used for its rapid onset of action.

**Which of the following is the most important reason for its more rapid onset compared with vecuronium?**

Priming doses are not required for rocuronium
Rocuronium has a lower volume of distribution
Rocuronium has lower potency
Rocuronium has pre-junctional action at the NMJ
Rocuronium is an aminosteroid

**Correct:** Rocuronium has lower potency 

The rapid onset of action of Rocuronium is because of its low potency, since the higher dose required for intubation will enhance the diffusion gradient between plasma and neuromuscular junction (Bowman principle).

## Question 13


A 59-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is undergoing a pulmonary function test. During the test, a flow-volume loop is generated, and it is observed that the expiratory flow decreases sharply after reaching peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).

**Which of the following best explains the observed decrease in expiratory flow in this patient?**

Increased airway resistance due to bronchoconstriction
Dynamic airway compression during forced expiration
Reduced lung compliance due to fibrosis
Decreased inspiratory muscle strength
Reduced alveolar surface area for gas exchange

**Correct:** Dynamic airway compression during forced expiration 

In patients with COPD, dynamic airway compression occurs during forced expiration due to high intrapleural pressure, which squashes small airways lacking cartilaginous support. This leads to increased resistance and effort-independent expiratory flow, explaining the sharp decrease in flow post-PEFR on the flow-volume loop.

## Question 14


You are working in a hospital located at an altitude of 3500 meters above sea level. The atmospheric pressure at this altitude is significantly lower than at sea level.

**How does this affect the delivery of a volatile anaesthetic agent using a variable bypass vaporizer calibrated at sea level?**

The partial pressure of the volatile agent delivered to the patient will be lower than intended.
The concentration of the volatile agent delivered to the patient will be higher than intended.
The vaporizer will automatically adjust to deliver the correct concentration of anaesthetic agent.
The saturated vapour pressure of the agent will decrease, reducing its volatility.
The vaporizer will not function at this altitude due to mechanical limitations.

**Correct:** The concentration of the volatile agent delivered to the patient will be higher than intended. 

At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which means that the same partial pressure of volatile agent will result in a higher concentration than what is dialled on the vaporizer calibrated for sea level. While the partial pressure remains constant, the concentration increases due to the lower atmospheric pressure.

## Question 15


A 30-year-old woman undergoes anaesthesia for a laparoscopic appendectomy. The anaesthetic plan includes the use of nitrous oxide as part of the maintenance of anaesthesia.

**What is a potential reason for the decreasing use of nitrous oxide in operating theatres?**

High potency leading to prolonged recovery time
Increased risk of cardiovascular instability
Potential to cause post-operative nausea and vomiting
Toxic metabolites causing liver damage
High metabolic rate leading to rapid depletion

**Correct:** Potential to cause post-operative nausea and vomiting 

Nitrous oxide is known to increase the risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting, which is one of the reasons its use in theatres is decreasing, despite its favourable physical properties. Additionally, environmental concerns related to its greenhouse effect contribute to its reduced usage. It does not have toxic metabolites that cause liver damage, nor does it have a high metabolic rate.

## Question 16

An odourless inhalational anaesthetic has the following properties: oil: gas partition coefficient = 1.9, blood:gas partition coefficient = 0.14, MAC = 71%, boiling point = -108 °C, It is non-irritant to the airway and is not metabolised.

**Which of the following is most likely to be true of this agent?**

More likely to produce hepatotoxicity than desflurane
Less volatile than desflurane
Potency greater than isoflurane
Slower offset than sevoflurane
Speed of onset faster than nitrous oxide

**Correct:** Speed of onset faster than nitrous oxide 

Onset and offset time are related to the blood:gas partition coefficient; at 0.14 the agent should have a faster onset/offset than even nitrous oxide Hepatotoxicity is unlikely as the agent is not metabolised. Volatility is related to boiling point: the lower the BP, the higher the volatility. Potency relates to oil:gas partition coefficient and MAC. The higher the oil:gas partition coefficient/lower the MAC, the greater the potency; so the new agent (1.9/71%) is the least potent of the agents mentioned. It is, in fact, Xenon.

## Question 17


A patient is being monitored for blood pressure using an automated oscillometric device in a high-dependency unit. The cuff is appropriately sized and placed at the level of the heart. The readings, however, show significant fluctuations which do not correlate with the clinical picture of the patient.

**Which of the following is the most likely cause of these inaccurate readings?**

Presence of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation
Incorrect cuff size
Patient's arm positioned above heart level
Use of a mercury sphygmomanometer
Leak in the cuff tubing

**Correct:** Presence of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation 

Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can cause significant fluctuations in blood pressure readings when using oscillometric devices, as these devices rely on detecting pulsations which can be irregular in such conditions. Other options are less likely given the context of the question.

## Question 18


You are asked to assess the behaviour of a gas stored in a cylinder. The cylinder is initially at room temperature but is moved to a colder storage area. As a result, the pressure gauge on the cylinder shows a decrease in pressure.

**Which of the following gas laws best explains this observation?**

Boyle's Law
Charles's Law
Gay-Lussac's Law
Avogadro's Law
Ideal Gas Law

**Correct:** Gay-Lussac's Law 

Gay-Lussac's Law, also known as the pressure law, states that the pressure of a gas at constant volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. Therefore, when the temperature decreases, the pressure also decreases, assuming the volume remains constant.

## Question 19


The composition of fluid filtered at the glomerulus varies at different points along the nephron. A sample of fluid from a nephron is obtained experimentally from an otherwise healthy anaesthetised patient immediately after nephrectomy for a small localised transitional cell tumour of the renal pelvis. It has the following composition:
Na+ concentration 140 mmol L-1
K+ concentration 4.5 mmol L-1
Glucose concentration 4.8 mmol L-1
Osmolality 285 mosm Kg-1

**From which of the following sites is the fluid most likely to have been obtained:**

Ascending limb of loop of Henle
Bowman's capsule
Collecting duct
Distal convoluted tubule
End proximal convoluted tubule

**Correct:** Bowman's capsule 

Bowman's capsule is an ultrafiltrate of plasma and so will have a near identical composition excepting proteins. The values given are typical of normal plasma. There will be no glucose from the late proximal convoluted tubule onwards as it is all normally reabsorbed.

## Question 20

A 34-year-old male presents with symptoms of muscle weakness and sensory disturbances. Neurological examination reveals signs suggestive of a demyelinating disorder. MRI shows demyelination in multiple areas of the central nervous system.

**Which of the following best explains the impact of demyelination on nerve conduction velocity?**

Decreased axon diameter reduces conduction velocity.
Increased membrane capacitance slows conduction velocity.
Enhanced transmembrane resistance accelerates conduction velocity.
Increased density of voltage-gated Na+ channels at the nodes of Ranvier enhances conduction velocity.
Increased extracellular ion concentration speeds conduction velocity.

**Correct:** Increased membrane capacitance slows conduction velocity. 

Demyelination increases membrane capacitance, which slows down the conduction of action potentials along the nerve. Myelin normally decreases membrane capacitance and increases transmembrane resistance, ensuring rapid conduction by enabling saltatory conduction. Without myelin, the increased capacitance means the membrane potential takes longer to change, thus slowing conduction velocity.

## Question 21


A 65-year-old male patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with a suspected respiratory tract infection. The sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the patient is started on an appropriate antibiotic regimen.

**Which of the following antibiotics is most likely being used to treat this infection?**

Amoxicillin
Ceftriaxone
Ciprofloxacin
Azithromycin
Metronidazole

**Correct:** Ciprofloxacin 

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is often used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections where Pseudomonas is involved. Amoxicillin and azithromycin are not typically effective against Pseudomonas. Ceftriaxone has limited activity against this organism, and metronidazole is used mainly for anaerobic infections.

## Question 22


In an experimental situation, a giant squid axon is bathed in an electrolyte solution containing chloride, potassium and sodium ions.

**Which of the following changes would have the greatest effect in making the resting membrane potential less negative?**

Decreasing the extracellular concentration of potassium ions
Decreasing the extracellular concentration of sodium ions
Increasing the extracellular concentration of chloride ions
Increasing the extracellular concentration of potassium ions
Increasing the extracellular concentration of sodium ions

**Correct:** Increasing the extracellular concentration of potassium ions 

The question tests knowledge of the Nernst equation and the fact that the resting membrane is relatively impermeable to sodium. Increasing extracellular potassium concentration will have the greatest effect in making the membrane potential less negative due to the membrane's high permeability to potassium ions at rest.

## Question 23


A 35-year-old male patient with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections is prescribed nitrofurantoin. The patient's culture shows a strain of Escherichia coli that is resistant to many first-line antibiotics.

**Which of the following mechanisms of action is responsible for the antimicrobial effect of nitrofurantoin?**

Inhibition of cell wall synthesis
Inhibition of protein synthesis
Disruption of cytoplasmic cellular membrane
Inhibition of DNA/RNA replication
Metabolic interference with bacterial enzymes

**Correct:** Metabolic interference with bacterial enzymes 

Nitrofurantoin works by interfering with bacterial enzymes and metabolism, leading to inhibition of bacterial growth. It is not primarily involved in inhibiting cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, or disrupting the cytoplasmic membrane. Its unique method of action makes it effective against strains resistant to other antibiotics.

## Question 24


During an anaesthetic procedure, a patient is observed to have a significant ventilation-perfusion mismatch leading to hypoxaemia.

**Which of the following interventions is most likely to improve the patient's oxygenation?**

Increase the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2)
Administer intravenous fluids to increase cardiac output
Apply positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
Use bronchodilators to reduce airway resistance
Perform a recruitment manoeuvre

**Correct:** Apply positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 

Applying PEEP helps keep alveoli open at the end of expiration, thereby increasing functional residual capacity and improving ventilation-perfusion matching. This intervention is particularly beneficial in cases of atelectasis, which often contribute to V/Q mismatch and hypoxaemia. Increasing FiO2 can help improve oxygenation temporarily but does not address the underlying V/Q mismatch. Administering fluids, using bronchodilators, or performing recruitment manoeuvres may assist under specific circumstances but are not as directly effective in improving V/Q mismatch as applying PEEP.

## Question 25


You are using a variable bypass vaporizer to deliver isoflurane during a routine surgery. The ambient temperature is stable, but the fresh gas flow rate is increased significantly.

**Which of the following mechanisms ensures a consistent delivery concentration of isoflurane despite the increased fresh gas flow?**

Automatic adjustment of the splitting ratio
Manual adjustment of the vaporizer setting
Use of a direct injection vaporizer
Elevating the temperature of the vaporizer chamber
Increasing the surface area of evaporation using wicks

**Correct:** Automatic adjustment of the splitting ratio 

Variable bypass vaporizers automatically adjust the splitting ratio to compensate for changes in ambient temperature or fresh gas flow. This ensures a consistent concentration of anaesthetic agent delivered to the patient. The splitting ratio refers to the proportion of gas that goes through the vaporizing chamber versus the bypass channel. Automatic adjustment helps maintain the set concentration without manual intervention.

## Question 26


In the fetus, blood supplying the brain has a higher oxygen content than blood supplying the trunk and lower limbs.

**Which of the following statements is the best explanation for this?**

Fetal haemoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity than adult haemoglobin, thereby maximising oxygen transfer in the placenta
Metabolic autoregulation of the cerebral circulation
The fetal circulation is so arranged that blood with a higher oxygen content flows preferentially across the foramen ovale and is ejected via the left ventricle into the carotid arteries
The ductus arteriosus ensures that most of the blood ejected from the pulmonary artery bypasses the collapsed fetal lungs
The ductus venosus ensures that a majority of oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein bypasses the portal hepatic circulation

**Correct:** The fetal circulation is so arranged that blood with a higher oxygen content flows preferentially across the foramen ovale and is ejected via the left ventricle into the carotid arteries 

While all the statements provided are true facts about fetal circulation, only statement C directly explains why blood supplying the brain has a higher oxygen content than blood supplying the trunk and lower limbs. The preferential flow of highly oxygenated blood across the foramen ovale and into the carotid arteries via the left ventricle creates this oxygen content difference.

## Question 27


A 60-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with signs of acute kidney injury. He has a history of hypertension and has been taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chronic back pain. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated serum creatinine level and a decreased urine output.

**Which of the following mechanisms is the most likely cause of his acute kidney injury?**

Afferent arteriolar vasodilation
Efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction
Decreased glomerular filtration rate due to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction
Increased tubular reabsorption of sodium
Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

**Correct:** Decreased glomerular filtration rate due to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction 

NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which can lead to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. This reduces the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), leading to acute kidney injury.

## Question 28


At atmospheric pressure, the column height of a mercury barometer is approximately 760 mm whereas that of a water barometer is approximately 10,000 mm.

**Which of the following statements best explains this?**

A mercury barometer has a Torricellian vacuum above the meniscus
A mercury barometer measures absolute pressure
Mercury is denser than water
Mercury is less viscous than water
The SVP of mercury at a given temperature is less than that of water

**Correct:** Mercury is denser than water 

The pressure exerted by a column of liquid is given by the equation: Pressure = density x acceleration due to gravity x height. Mercury is approximately 13 times denser than water. All the other statements are irrelevant to explaining the difference in column heights.

## Question 29

A 35-year-old woman is undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia. During the procedure, the anaesthetist decides to use a volatile anaesthetic agent known for its rapid onset and offset due to its low blood:gas partition coefficient, but also notes it requires a special vaporiser due to its high volatility.

**Which of the following agents is most likely being used?**

Sevoflurane
Isoflurane
Halothane
Desflurane
Nitrous Oxide

**Correct:** Desflurane 

Desflurane has a very low blood:gas partition coefficient, which accounts for its rapid onset and offset. It is highly volatile and requires a special heated vaporiser for administration.
source: minerva

---
## Question 30

A 35-year-old man is undergoing a minor surgical procedure under local
anaesthesia. The anaesthetist uses lidocaine to block nerve conduction.

**Which of the following effects of lidocaine best explains its ability to block action potentials**

Inhibition of sodium channel inactivation
Increased potassium efflux during repolarisation
Prolongation of the refractory period
Reduction of sodium permeability during depolarisation
Stabilisation of the resting membrane potential

**Correct:** Reduction of sodium permeability during depolarisation

Lidocaine blocks action potentials primarily by reducing sodium permeability during depolarisation. This prevents the rapid influx of sodium ions required for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. Inhibition of sodium channel inactivation and prolongation of the refractory period are not the primary actions of lidocaine. Increased potassium efflux and stabilisation of the resting membrane potential are not directly related to the action of lidocaine on blocking action potentials.
