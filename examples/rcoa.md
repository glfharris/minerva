An odourless inhalational anaesthetic has the following properties:
oil: gas partition coefficient = 1.9
blood:gas partition coefficient = 0.14
MAC = 71%
boiling point = -108 °C
It is non-irritant to the airway and is not metabolised.

Which of the following is most likely to be true of this agent?

A More likely to produce hepatotoxicity than desflurane
B Less volatile than desflurane
C Potency greater than isoflurane
D Slower offset than sevoflurane
E Speed of onset faster than nitrous oxide

Correct answer: E

Onset and offset time are related to the blood:gas partition coefficient; at 0.14 the
agent should have a faster onset/offset than even nitrous oxide Hepatotoxicity is
unlikely as the agent is not metabolised. Volatility is related to boiling point: the
lower the BP, the higher the volatility. Potency relates to oil:gas partition coefficient
and MAC. The higher the oil:gas partition coefficient/lower the MAC, the greater the
potency; so the new agent (1.9/71%) is the least potent of the agents mentioned. It
is, in fact, Xenon.

The non-depolarising neuromuscular blocker rocuronium is sometimes used for its
rapid onset of action.

Which of the following is the most important reason for its more rapid onset
compared with vecuronium?

A Priming doses are not required for rocuronium
B Rocuronium has a lower volume of distribution
C Rocuronium has lower potency
D Rocuronium has pre-junctional action at the NMJ
E Rocuronium is an aminosteroid

Correct answer: C

The rapid onset of action of Rocuronium is because of its low potency, since the
higher dose required for intubation will enhance the diffusion gradient between
plasma and neuromuscular junction (Bowman principle).

A drug has an initial volume of distribution = 0.1 Litre Kg^-1 and a rate constant of
elimination k = 0.1 min^-1. It obeys a one-compartment model. An intravenous bolus
dose of 500 mg is given to a healthy 50 Kg subject.

Which of the following is the most likely plasma drug concentration after two
minutes?
A 1.0 mcg mL^-1
B 25.2 mcg mL^-1
C 81.9 mcg mL^-1
D 98.8 mcg mL^-1
E 100.0 mcg mL^-1

Correct answer: C

The initial concentration = Dose/Vd = 500 000 mcgg/5 000 mL = 100 mcg.mL^-1.
Approximate calculation: after one minute, 10% (k expressed as %) of plasma will
be cleared of drug, giving a concentration = 90 mcg.mL^-1. Assuming a one
compartment model, one minute later, a further 10% will give a concentration = 81
mcg.mL^-1.
Exact calculation: ln (C/C0) = -kt*C=81.9 mcg mL^-1.

A 50-year-old woman is anaesthetised for cystoscopy and injection of botulinum
toxin into the bladder for detrusor instability.

Which of the following best explains the therapeutic effect of botulinum toxin?

A Antagonism of acetylcholine at the post-junctional receptor
B Increased neuronal re-uptake of acetylcholine
C Inhibition of acetylcholine release 
D Inhibition of acetylcholine synthesis
E Potentiation of acetylcholinesterase

Correct answer: C

Botulinum toxin is an exotoxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium
botulinum and now used as a therapeutic drug. It inhibits acetylcholine release from
nerve terminals.

A patient with atypical pneumonia is prescribed clarithromycin.

Inhibition of which of the following mechanisms best explains the antibiotic action of
clarithromycin?

A Bacterial energy metabolism
B Cell wall synthesis
C DNA synthesis
D Protein synthesis
E RNA synthesis

Correct answer: D

Macrolides such as clarithromycin inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the
ribosome and interfering with translocation. The other mechanisms are modes of
action of other antibiotics.

You are comparing pressure-volume curves in patients during an asthma attack
compared with healthy subjects.

Which of the following observed differences is the best indicator of the increased
work of breathing in the patients with asthma?

A Larger hysteresis loop
B Longer expiratory time
C Pressure-volume curve starts at a higher end-expiratory pressure
D Slope of the inspiratory limb is initially less steep
E Tidal volume is smaller

Correct answer: A

The work of breathing is best indicated by the area within the hysteresis loop.

In an experimental situation, a giant squid axon is bathed in an electrolyte solution
containing chloride, potassium and sodium ions.

Which of the following changes would have the greatest effect in making the resting
membrane potential less negative?

A Decreasing the extracellular concentration of potassium ions
B Decreasing the extracellular concentration of sodium ions
C Increasing the extracellular concentration of chloride ions
D Increasing the extracellular concentration of potassium ions
E Increasing the extracellular concentration of sodium ions

Correct answer: D

The question simply tests knowledge of the Nernst equation and the fact that the
resting membrane is relatively impermeable to sodium.

In the fetus, blood supplying the brain has a higher oxygen content than blood
supplying the trunk and lower limbs.

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for this?

A fetal haemoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity than adult haemoglobin, thereby
maximising oxygen transfer in the placenta
B metabolic autoregulation of the cerebral circulation
C the fetal circulation is so arranged that blood with a higher oxygen content flows
preferentially across the foramen ovale and is ejected via the left ventricle into the carotid
arteries
D the ductus arteriosus ensures that most of the blood ejected from the pulmonary
artery bypasses the collapsed fetal lungs
E the ductus venosus ensures that a majority of oxygenated blood from the
umbilical vein bypasses the portal hepatic circulation

Correct answer: C

All the statements are true. However, only C answers the question directly.

The composition of fluid filtered at the glomerulus varies at different points along the
nephron. A sample of fluid from a nephron is obtained experimentally from an
otherwise healthy anaesthetised patient immediately after nephrectomy for a small
localised transitional cell tumour of the renal pelvis. It has the following composition:
Na+ concentration 140 mmol L-1
K+ concentration 4.5 mmol L-1
Glucose concentration 4.8 mmol L-1
Osmolality 285 mosm Kg-1

From which of the following sites is the fluid most likely to have been obtained:

A Ascending limb of loop of Henle
B Bowman’s capsule
C Collecting duct
D Distal convoluted tubule
E End proximal convoluted tubule

Correct answer: B

Bowman’s capsule is an ultrafiltrate of plasma and so will have a near identical
composition excepting proteins. The values given are typical of normal plasma.
There will be no glucose from the late PCT onwards as it is all normally reabsorbed.

A 72-year-old man complains of numbness in his feet and difficulty walking. On
examination he has normal pain and temperature sensation in his lower limbs, but
decreased appreciation of light touch and proprioception.

Which of the following is the most likely site of a neurological lesion?

A Dorsal columns
B Dorsal horn grey matter
C Lateral corticospinal tracts
D Lateral spinothalamic tracts
E Spinocerebellar tracts

Correct answer: A

Fine touch, proprioception and vibration sensations are all conveyed in the dorsal
column tracts.

A randomised prospective double-blind study is undertaken to determine the efficacy
of a new drug to treat hypertension. 460 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients are
assigned either to the treatment or placebo group. Measurements of arterial blood
pressure are made after three months.

Which of the following statistical tests is most appropriate to determine whether the
systolic blood pressure in the active treatment group is significantly lower than that in
the placebo group at three months?

A Chi-squared analysis
B Fisher’s Exact Test
C Mann Whitney U-test
D Student’s unpaired t-test
E Wilcoxon matched pairs test

Correct answer: D

The patients are not used as their own controls, so E is incorrect and is a non-
parametric test in any case. C is reasonable but is not the statistically most powerful
test as it is non-parametric and we may reasonably assume BP data are normally
distributed from such a large sample. A & B are tests of association between groups
of categorical data. These tests could be used if the patients were categorised as
treatment success or failure.

At atmospheric pressure, the column height of a mercury barometer is approximately
760 mm whereas that of a water barometer is approximately 10 000 mm.

Which of the following statements best explains this?

A A mercury barometer has a Torricellian vacuum above the meniscus
B A mercury barometer measures absolute pressure
C Mercury is denser than water
D Mercury is less viscous than water
E The SVP of mercury at a given temperature is less than that of water

Correct answer: C

The pressure exerted by a column of liquid is given by the equation: Pressure =
density x acceleration due to gravity x height. Mercury is approximately 13 times
denser than water. All the other statements are irrelevant.

You are using isoflurane (vaporizer dial setting 2.0%, end-tidal concentration = 1.2%)
to maintain anaesthesia using a circle system with the vaporizer out-of-circuit and
fresh gas flow (FGF) = 400 ml min -1 of an oxygen/air mixture. It is now necessary
to increase the depth of anaesthesia to 1.5 MAC equivalent.

Which of the following is the quickest method of increasing the depth of anaesthesia
to 1.5 MAC equivalent?

A Change the vaporizer setting to isoflurane 1.5%
B Increase the FGF to 8 L min-1
C Increase the vaporizer setting by 50%
D Switch to a nitrous oxide/oxygen mix with FiO2 = 0.3
E Switch to a nitrous oxide/oxygen mix with FiO2 = 0.5

Correct answer: B

Changing the composition of the inspired gas mixture will take a long time at such a
low FGF rate due to the inertia of the circle system. The quickest option to increase
the end-tidal isoflurane concentration is to increase the FGF rate. Option A does not
achieve 1.5 MAC (MAC isoflurane = 1.2%). Option E does achieve this and option D
overachieves but will take longer.

Energy exists in various forms, such as chemical energy within compounds, kinetic
energy due to motion, electrical energy and potential energy due to an object’s state
or position.

Which of the following is associated with the most energy?

A An object with a mass of 2000 Kg moving at 100 m s-1
B Energy released when 1 Kg glucose is metabolised to CO2 and water (the metabolic energy content of glucose is approximately 16 kJ g-1)
C Raising the temperature of 25 Kg water from 0 °C to 100 °C (the specific heat capacity of water is approximately 4 kJ per Kg per °C)
D Raising a 1000 Kg mass to a height of 1 Km against gravity (acceleration due to gravity = g = 10 m s-2)
E The heat generated when a direct current of 10 amps flows through a heating element for 100 seconds when the potential difference across the element is 10 000 volts

Correct answer: B

This question requires knowledge of various energy equations.
A relates to kinetic energy = ½ m v2 = 1000x10 000 = 10 MJ
B relates to the metabolic energy content of carbohydrate = 1000x16000=16 MJ
C relates to specific heat capacity and the relevant equation = mass x SHC x temperature change = 25x4x1000x100=10 MJ
D relates to potential energy = mgh=1000x10x1000=10MJ
E relates to electrical energy=IV x seconds = 10x10000x100=10MJ

A 40-year-old 70 Kg man presents to the Emergency Department with an
estimated 30% body surface area severe thermal injury that occurred 1 h
ago in a house fire. He smells strongly of alcohol and is violently agitated
and confused.
Carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) = 30% on arterial blood gas analysis. There
is no evidence of an inhalational thermal injury. It is decided that he
requires immediate intubation and ventilation.

Which of the following is the most appropriate technique for
induction of anaesthesia?

A Inhalational induction with sevoflurane in oxygen
B Modified rapid sequence induction with sodium thiopental and rocuronium 
C Rapid sequence induction with propofol and remifentanil
D Rapid sequence induction with sodium thiopental and succinylcholine 
E Fibreoptic intubation under local anaesthesia

Correct answer: D

Succinylcholine is safe for the first 24h after thermal injury. There is no
contraindication to a standard RSI, which is the best technique to
intubate the trachea rapidly because a full stomach (alcoholic
beverage +/- food) is a distinct possibility.
